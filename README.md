# README

## Project Overview
This repository contains code and resources for the **ccomp** project. The goal of this project is to build a simple C compiler that will generate code for my MacBook Air as well as the rosco_m68k 68000 sbc.  The dialect of C is c23 and the code is written in c23.  Hopefully, ccomp should be able to compile itself .. it is far from being able to do that at present ..
